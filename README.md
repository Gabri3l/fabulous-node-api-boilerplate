# Fabulous Node API Boilerplate

This boilerplate aims to build a tool to quickly setup a simple API with Node, powered by Express! It will also provide an ES6 ready environment to start leveraging the coolest newest JS features, along with some ready-to-go MongoDB models and basic Mongoose schemas. Setting up an environment to maximize your productivity is not too hard when developing an API, nonetheless I want to make the process even faster with this fabulous boilerplate!
